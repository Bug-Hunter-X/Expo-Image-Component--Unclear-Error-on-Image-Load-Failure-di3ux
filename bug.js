This error occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that is not properly formatted or points to an inaccessible resource.  It can also manifest if the network request to fetch the image fails due to issues like a slow or offline connection, incorrect permissions, or the image server being down.  The error message might be vague, offering little insight into the root cause. 

```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'invalid-image-uri' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```
